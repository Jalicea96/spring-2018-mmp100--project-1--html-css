      <h2 style="text-align: center;">What I Find Interesting About Hideo Kojima</h2>
      <p>The reason I chose Hideo Kojima is that of his fame in the gaming industry. Hideo is known as one of the most talented developers and is the creator of many games but the series he is most popular for is the metal gear series. As a child, Hideo had to watch movies every night and wouldn't be allowed to sleep until the movie ended. growing up Hideo wanted to become an artist, filmmaker, or illustrator but was discouraged by his family and the social norms of Japan at that time. Hideo decided to study economics but while studying for his degree Hideo found himself playing video games whenever he had free time. after a while, Hideo decided he wanted to switch career paths and chose to become a part of the video game industry which at that time was not as popular and financially stable as it is now. though many of his classmates tried to discourage him Hideo chose to go down his own path with the support of his mother who gave him the confidence to follow his dreams. later on, in life with much success, Hideo would become the Vice president of Konami, one of the leading game companies of our time. after some turmoil with Konami, Hideo decided to start his own gaming production company known as Kojima Productions and is slated to release the high anticipated Death Stranding game scheduled to be released this year. Hideo's story is one that I admire, even though he started off doing something he didn't love and having no one believe in him Hideo fought hard to become who he is today. Hideo's life journey is one of determination, perseverance, and hard work, this is why Hideo inspires me to choose my own path in life no matter what others think.
